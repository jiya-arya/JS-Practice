# JS-Practice
JavaScript practice projects organized by day (Day 1–12). Covers variables, arrays, strings, DOM, events, functions, loops, and practical tasks like counters, To-Do list, show/hide password, and more.

This repository contains my JavaScript practice projects, organized by day. Each folder represents a day of exercises, covering fundamental JavaScript concepts and hands-on tasks. The main styles are included in `style.css` for consistent design across exercises.

Folder Structure:
- Day 1, Day 2, … Day 12 → Each contains HTML, JS files for the tasks of that day
- style.css → shared styling for the exercises

Concepts covered include:
- Variables, data types, arrays, and strings
- DOM manipulation and element selection
- Event handling (click, input, etc.)
- Functions, loops, and conditional statements
- Real-world small projects: Character counter, Button click counter, Show/Hide password, To-Do list, etc.

This repository demonstrates hands-on practice and gradual learning of JavaScript from fundamentals to applied tasks.
